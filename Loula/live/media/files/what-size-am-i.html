<h1>Choosing your size</h1>
<p>Most of us are familiar with our shoe size, but sometimes sizes can differ between shoe brands and not all styles are made in half sizes.
For this reason it is important that you read the description accompanying each style carefully. If a style is not a standard fit, we try to let you know whether it is a large, small, narrow or wide fit, to help you in your decision making.</p>
<p>As a rule though we would recommend that you order shoes in the size you would normally take. The ladies international size conversion chart below, may also assist you. Please note that should you be unhappy with the fit of your purchase, you may exchange it for a different size or style, subject to availablity and in accordance with our exchange policy.</p>

<h2>What if have wide or narrow feet?</h2>
<p>The shoes at Show Show and on our website generally come in standard width fittings, so if you have a very wide feet you may want to consider going up a size.</p><p>
Alternatively if you have very narrow feet you may require an innersole and/or heel grips to achieve a comfortable fit.</p>
<h2>What if I have one foot bigger than the other?</h2>
<p>Most people have one foot larger than the other. When choosing your size it's always important to cater for your largest foot. Inner soles and heel grips can be used very effectively inside the shoe containing your smaller foot when there is a significant size difference.</p>
<h2>I’m a 7 ½ but the style I want doesn't come in half sizes, which size do I choose?</h2>
<p>Generally speaking a size 8 would be the best choice.</p>
